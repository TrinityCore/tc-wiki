## Getting started

This how-to will attempt to help with TrinityCore, and also show how this can be done in a way that also shows you the basics of how linux compilations works.

> Most of this how-to is based on the use of a Debian based distribution, though we'll try to inform as best as we can when something differs totally.
{.is-info}

> **Hint**
DON'T clone, compile or run server as sudo or root.
{.is-info}

**Advices**:

- Read your distributions' documentation on how to install packages, and also have at least knowledge on how it works with regards to adding users.
- Run/install TrinityCore on a dedicated machine, or a machine that you know you have full control over.
- Do NOT install the software on a shared server solution or any server where other users may have access or might require resources to be available at all times.


**Your server may be abruptly killed by an angry administrator or system staff or by system restrictions for overuse of system resources and you willl see something like:**

>collect2: fatal error: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed] compilation terminated.

**You will need to use less jobs (make -j1) or increase swap.**
&nbsp;

### Creating a user to work with

Start with logging in to your Linux-machine and create an account for the server itself - on most recent distributions this can easily be done with the following command :
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
sudo adduser username
```

Note: Change "username" into the preferred username of your server-account - we will as far as possible avoid using specific usernames in this how-to.

Sample usernames found in various parts of this guide: **wow , trinity** ( - select a logical name that makes sense to you when creating the user - ).
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
su - username
```

Note : Change your current user to "username" so everything will run and compile with the user you just have created.

&nbsp;

### Required Software

See [Requirements](/install/requirements/)

&nbsp;

### Building the server itself
**Getting the source code**

3.3.5 (wotlk client)
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cd ~/
git clone -b 3.3.5 https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore.git
```

This will clone 3.3.5a branch, this is the  **RECOMMENDED**  branch for starters.

master (check [Trinitycore Github](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) for current version)
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cd ~/
git clone -b master https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore.git
```

This will clone **master** branch, note that this is **NOT** the recommended branch for starters.
&nbsp;
The directory **TrinityCore** will be created automatically and all the source files will be stored in there.

&nbsp;

### Compiling the source code

**Creating the build-directory**

To avoid issues with updates and colliding source builds, we create a specific build-directory, so we avoid any possible issues due to that (if any might occur)
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cd TrinityCore
mkdir build
cd build
```

**Configuring for compiling**

To configure the core, we use space-separated parameters attached to the configuration-tool (cmake) - **do read the entire section before even starting on the configuration-part.**
<ins>This is for your own good, and you HAVE been warned. A full example will also be shown underneath the explanations.</ins>

<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cmake ../ [additional parameters]
```
&nbsp;

#### Parameter explanations (advanced users)

path to your OpenSSL library - **use if you have OpenSSL installed system wide with a different version than required by TrinityCore**

>-DOPENSSL_LIBRARIES=path to OpenSSL library

path to your OpenSSL includes directory - **use if you have OpenSSL installed system wide with a different version than required by TrinityCore:**

>-DOPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR=path to OpenSSL includes

| - DSCRIPTS_PET | 	- **"static"**: Compiles the given module as a static library. |  |  | \
| - DSCRIPTS_SPELLS | 	{.grid-list} |  |  | \

| {.grid-list} |  |  |  |
| DLIBSDIR | Sets libraries directory. (Advanced users only) | -DLIBSDIR=/lib |  |
| DCONF_DIR | Sets configuration directory. (Advanced users only) | -DCONF_DIR=/home/trinitycore/conf | /usr/local/lib |
| DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX | Path to the directory where TrinityCore will be installed. Required for script hotswapping. | -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/trinitycore/bin | /usr/local/etc |
| DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS | Set CXX_FLAGS for compilation. (Advanced users only) | -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++11 -O0" | /usr/local |
| DCMAKE_C_FLAGS | Set C_FLAGS for compilation. (Advanced users only) | -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-msse3 -O3" |  |

**The above parameters when combined into a full example:**

> By default this is the only row you will need to run to setup your install:
> <div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>
> 
> ```bash
> cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/username/server
> ```
>
>More examples below: 
><div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>
>
>```bash
>cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/wow/server -DTOOLS=0
>cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/$USER/server -DTOOLS=0 -DWITH_WARNINGS=1
>```
  
The 1st row builds the core with the tools, set installation base directory to **/home/username/server**.

The 2nd row builds the core without the tools, set installation base directory to **/home/wow/server**. 

The 3nd row builds the core without the tools, set installation base directory to **/home/$user/server and enables warnings**.

> NOTE: 
If you see
> "-- Performing Test boost_filesystem_copy_links_without_NO_SCOPED_ENUM - Failed" 
IGNORE, it's a warning.

Note that you WILL have to configure the server well if you ever want to use the RA-access functionality.

### Building the core

&nbsp;

After configuring and checking that everything is in order (read cmakes output), you can build Trinity (this will take some time unless you are on a rather fast machine)
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
make
make install
```

If you have multiple CPU cores, you can enable the use of those during compile :
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
make -j X(number of cores)
make install 
```

Alternatively:
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
make -j $(nproc) install
```

After compiling and installing, you will find your core binaries in **/home/username/server/bin**, and the standard configuration files in the **/home/username/server/etc** folder.
 (*As usual, replace username with the username you created earlier*). Now you can continue reading on and learn how how to update the source tree.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
### Keeping the code up to date

TrinityCore developers are always at work fixing and adding new features to the core. You can always check them [here](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/commits/3.3.5). To update the core files, do the following 

For 3.3.5 Branch:
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cd ~/TrinityCore/
git pull origin 3.3.5
```

For master Branch
<div class="next-codeblock-no-line-numbers"></div>

```bash
cd ~/TrinityCore/
git pull origin master
```

Afterwards return to the "Compiling the source code" section again, and repeat the instructions there.

### Installing MySQL Server


When configuring MySQL make sure you remember the password you set for the default root account and that you enabled both MyISAM and InnoDB engines.

**SPECIAL NOTES! you don't need to read this unless you want to do custom installations.**

Things to notice :

>-DWITH_COREDEBUG=0 not required, this flag is only for core developers as its default is : 0. If you want to compile core in debug mode you need to use -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

The paths for installation can be done without any other parameters but this :
>-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/where/you/want/core/to/be/installed

It will create the following structure:

>"path"/bin/ - binaries will be placed here
"path"/etc/ - config files will be placed here

> Please remember to rename the **worldserver.conf.dist** and **authserver.conf.dist** files in **worldserver.conf** and **authserver.conf** respectively, unless you want to keep the configuration files of a previously compiled version of the core.
