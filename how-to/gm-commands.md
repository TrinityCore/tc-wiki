# GM Commands
GM commands can be entered mainly in 2 ways: 

- Typing it directly into the worldserver console window. In this case, the leading dot (.) is not mandantory, but you can use it.
- Using the gm command ingame in the chat console of the wow client. There, all commands must start with a leading dot. Ex: `.gm on`

Tip: You can still use gm commands while your character is dead by typing them in the guild chat (/g).

Note: Some commands are working only by selecting a player or a creature. These commands can not be used in the worldserver console.
