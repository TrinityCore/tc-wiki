### VerifiedBuild
This field is used by the TrinityDB Team to determine whether a template has been verified from WDB files.

If value is 0 then it has not been parsed yet.

If value is above 0 then it has been parsed with WDB files from that specific client build.

If value is -1 then it is just a place holder until proper data are found on WDBs.

If value is -Client Build then it was parsed with WDB files from that specific client build and manually edited later for some special necessity.
